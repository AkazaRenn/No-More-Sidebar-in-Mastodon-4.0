# No More Sidebar in Mastodon 4.0

Install from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/454048-no-more-sidebar-in-mastodon-4-0).

Need [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) to work with.

## standalone.css

This file is a pure CSS theme that can be applied as a Mastondon custom theme, in which way getting back top navigation bar without a browser extension is possible. It does a similar thing as `script.js` but has more limitations (both visually and functionally) due to the nature of CSS (alone with the poor coding of the project it applies to). 

**You don't need to use the script together with it, actually by applying the script, what has been changed in it will mostly get removed.**

# Credits

Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko and his highly respected "professional designer"
who provided the chance for this script.

# Warning

The owner of the project knows nothing about JavaScript or CSS. All the codes are written by a monkey who breach into their room regularly. The owner will try their best to transfer the needs of the users to the monkey, but no guarantees nor warranties will be provided.
