# No More Sidebar in Mastodon 4.0

Install from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/454048-no-more-sidebar-in-mastodon-4-0).

Need [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) to work with.

## standalone.css

**Do NOT set it as the default theme of your instance, it will likely block the login button. Please make sure only logged-in users are using it.**

This file is a pure CSS theme that can be applied as a Mastondon custom theme, in which way getting back top navigation bar without a browser extension is possible. It does a similar thing as `script.js` but has more limitations (both visually and functionally) due to the nature of CSS (alone with the poor coding of the project it applies to). 

**You don't need to use the script together with it, actually by applying the script, what has been changed in it will mostly get removed.**
