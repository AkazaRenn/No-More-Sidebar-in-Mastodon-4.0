# No More Sidebar in Mastodon 4.0

Install from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/454048-no-more-sidebar-in-mastodon-4-0).

Need [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) to work with.

# Credits

Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko and his highly respected "professional designer"
who provided the chance for me to make this script.
